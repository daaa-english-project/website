<section class="intro-section">
    <h2>Understanding Imports and Exports</h2>
    <p>In international trade, "imports" and "exports" are two fundamental terms that describe the flow of goods and services between countries. Let's break these concepts down:</p>
    
    <h3>What Are Imports?</h3>
    <p>Imports refer to goods and services that are brought into a country from abroad. When a nation does not produce enough of a certain product or service, it can import it from other countries that specialize in manufacturing or providing it. Imports are crucial for fulfilling domestic demand, especially for items that are unavailable locally.</p>
    
    <h3>What Are Exports?</h3>
    <p>Exports, on the other hand, refer to goods and services that are produced in one country and sent to other countries for sale or use. Exporting allows countries to sell their surplus products to international markets, contributing to economic growth and creating business opportunities abroad. By exporting, a nation can strengthen its economy and form valuable trade relationships.</p>
    
    <p>Both imports and exports are integral to a country's economic health and global standing. These activities allow nations to access resources they may lack while contributing to the global economy by selling their own goods and services. Through imports and exports, countries can foster economic cooperation and growth on an international scale.</p>

    <section class="trade-flows-section">
        <h2>Three Major Types of Trade Flows</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Industrial:</strong> Includes products such as machinery, electronics, and automobiles. For example, electric cars involve sourcing lithium from Chile, refining it in China, assembling cars in Germany, and distributing them globally.</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Trade in crops like coffee (grown in Brazil, exported globally) and wheat (produced in the US and exported to Europe).</li>
            <li><strong>Services:</strong> Includes tourism (e.g., travelers from Europe visiting Asian destinations) and IT services (e.g., software development outsourced to India).</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>The Electric Car Revolution</h2>
    <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming the automobile industry. Below is a video discussing these challenges:</p>

    </div>
    <p>The electric car production chain involves multiple steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> Lithium from Chile, cobalt from the Congo.</li>
        <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> Processed in China and South Korea.</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Assembled in Europe and the US.</li>
        <li><strong>Sales:</strong> Distributed to global markets.</li>
    </ol>

        <p>
        Historically, the main hubs of car production were concentrated in Japan, the United States, and Western Europe. These regions dominated the market due to their advanced technologies, industrial expertise, and well-developed infrastructure.
        However, in recent years, China has taken a central role in the global automotive industry, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) sector.
        With its massive production capacity and government support, China has become a key player, significantly shaping the future of the automobile market.
